#1. Python Encapsulation
"""
-> Encapsulation is about protecting data inside a class.
-> It means keeping data(properties) and methods together in a class, while controlling how the data can be accessed from 
   outside the class.
-> This prevents accidental changes to our data and hides the internal details of how our class works(higher abstraction).
"""




#2. Private Properties
"""
-> Private properties cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
-> In Python, we can make properties private by using double underscore(__) prefix.
"""
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.__age = age # Private property

p1 = Person("Emil", 25)
print(p1.name)
#print(p1.__age) # This will cause an error





#3. Get Private Property Value
"""
-> To access a private property, we can create a getter method.
"""

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.__age = age

  def get_age(self):
    return self.__age

p1 = Person("Tobias", 25)
print(p1.get_age())




#4. Set Private Property Value
"""
-> To modify a private property, we can create a setter method.
-> The setter method can also validate the value before setting it.
"""
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.__age = age

  def get_age(self):
    return self.__age

  def set_age(self, age):
    if age > 0:
      self.__age = age
    else:
      print("Age must be positive")

p1 = Person("Tobias", 25)
print(p1.get_age())

p1.set_age(26)
print(p1.get_age())





#5. Why To Use Encapsulation?
"""
-> Encapsulation provides several benefits such as:
   
       1. Data Protection : Prevents accidental modification of data
       2. Validation      : We can validate data before setting it
       3. Flexibility     : Internal implementation can change without affecting external code
       4. Control         : We can have full control over how data is accessed and modified
"""
class Student:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.__grade = 0

  def set_grade(self, grade):
    if 0 <= grade <= 100:
      self.__grade = grade
    else:
      print("Grade must be between 0 and 100")

  def get_grade(self):
    return self.__grade

  def get_status(self):
    if self.__grade >= 60:
      return "Passed"
    else:
      return "Failed"

student = Student("Emil")
student.set_grade(85)
print(student.get_grade())
print(student.get_status())





#6. Protected Properties
"""
-> Python also has a convention for protected properties using a single underscore(_) prefix.
-> A single underscore(_) is just a convention. It tells other programmers that the property is intended for internal use, but
   Python doesn't enforce this restriction.
"""
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, salary):
    self.name = name
    self._salary = salary # Protected property

p1 = Person("Linus", 50000)
print(p1.name)
print(p1._salary) # Can access, but shouldn't





#7. Private Methods
"""
-> We can also make methods private using the double underscore(__) prefix.
-> Just like private properties with double underscores, private methods cannot be called directly outside the class.
   For in example below, the __validate() method can only be used by other methods inside the class.
"""
class Calculator:
  def __init__(self):
    self.result = 0

  def __validate(self, num):
    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
      return False
    return True

  def add(self, num):
    if self.__validate(num):
      self.result += num
    else:
      print("Invalid number")

calc = Calculator()
calc.add(10)
calc.add(5)
print(calc.result)
# calc.__validate(5) # This would cause an error



#8. Name Mangling
"""
-> Name mangling is how Python implements private properties and methods.
-> When we use double underscores(__), Python automatically renames it internally by adding _ClassName in front.
-> For example, __age becomes _Person__age.
-> While we can access private properties using the mangled name, it's not recommended. It defeats the purpose of encapsulation.
"""
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.__age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 30)

# This is how Python mangles the name:
print(p1._Person__age) # Not recommended!
