#Python Outputs

"""
-> Python uses print() function to display text or output values.
-> We can use the print() function as many times we want. Each call prints text on a new line by default.
-> We can use either double quotes (" ") or single quotes(' ') to print text in python.
-> If we forget to place text inside the double or single quotes, it will give you an error.
"""

print("This is the way of printing text in python.")

#Print Without New Line
"""
-> By default,the print() function ends with a new line.
-> If we want to print multiple words on the same line, we can use end parameter.
"""
print("Hello, World!", end=" ")
print("This  will print on the same line.")

# We can also print numbers in the same way using print() function. But the numbers does not need to be placed inside the double quotes.

print("I am ", 20 ,"years old.")
